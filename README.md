This is currently a bot made for Multiplayer Piano.

## Building

*Please* only run this on linux/WSL. It's probably really hard to run on Windows.

This project uses Node.js, Deno, C, and Nim. The decision to use such languages was a brave one.

```sh
$ yarn
# This will install all required packages
```

```sh
$ yarn build
# This will build everything
```

```sh
$ yarn start
# This will start
```

```sh
$ yarn dev
# This will build everything and start
```
